# Eight-Queens (WIP) 
On an 8x8 Chess board there exists 92 distinct solutions (including symmetric rotations) for the placement of eight queens such that none attack each other.

This program intends to algorithmically determine valid orientations for such positions.

Example:

Note: Feel free to copy and reproduce the program however this is intended to be a rudementary solution to the problem using basic python methods, more efficient solutions do exist and this is meant for educational experimentation
